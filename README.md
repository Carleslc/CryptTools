### Caesar

[--> What is the Caesar Cipher? <--](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

#### Usage

`./caesar.py --help`
```
usage: caesar.py [-h] [-t TEXT] [-k KEY] [-l LANG] [-V] [-A] [-D]
                 [-T THRESHOLD] [--beep]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEXT, --text TEXT  text to read from. If not specified the program will
                        read from standard input
  -k KEY, --key KEY     key used to encrypt. If no key is provided the program
                        will try to crack and decrypt using the specified
                        language
  -l LANG, --lang LANG  available languages: ['de_DE', 'en_AU', 'en_GB',
                        'en_US', 'fr_FR'] (default: en_US). Only useful if no
                        key is provided
  -V, --verbose         show extra information
  -A, --all             show decrypted text for each tested key
  -D, --debug           show information about text validation
  -T THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        valid word count percentage to mark the whole text as
                        valid language (default: 50)
  --beep                plays a beep sound when program finishes. May require
                        SOX to be installed
```

##### Examples

###### Encrypt a text and save to a file

**`./caesar.py -t "This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!" -k 5 > test`**
```
Ymnx nx ymj Hfjxfw yttq kwtr HwduyYttqx!
```

`-t` argument is not mandatory, so if you need to encrypt a long text you can skip it, execute `./caesar.py -k 5 > test` and then paste your text. When completed press `Return` and then finish the input with `Ctrl+D` so the program will read it.

###### Encrypt with extra information

**`./caesar.py -t "This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!" -k 5 -VA`**
```
Original text most frequent character: t

Ymnx nx ymj Hfjxfw yttq kwtr HwduyYttqx!

Encrypted text most frequent character: y
```

###### Decrypt with a known key

To decrypt you will need to know the shift needed to reallocate each character to its correct character in the alphabet. In the example above the encrypted shift is 5 so the shift needed to decrypt is 26 - 5 = 21, where 26 is the size of the alphabet.

**`./caesar.py -k 21 < test`**
```
This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!
```

###### Decrypt without knowing the key

This method cracks the message with bruteforce and then checks every result validating the language to guess which result is the original text. By default language is English, for other languages read below.

**`./caesar.py < test`**
```
This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!
```

###### Advanced features

Read from a file and print cracked keys:

**`./caesar.py -V < test`**
```
Most frequent character: y
Testing 't' (ROT-21)       SUCCESS
Decrypted with ROT-21. Original encryption key: 5
This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!
```

ROT-X means that each character in the text is shifted X positions in the alphabet.

To decrypt a message without knowing the key you need to know the original text **language**. It is provided with `--lang` option. By default it is `en_US` (American English).

For example, in _Deutsch_ language:

`./caesar.py -t "Dies ist das Scytale-Tool von CryptTools!" -k 6`
```
Joky oyz jgy Yiezgrk-Zuur but IxevzZuury!
```

If language is not provided it will try English and it will fail:

**`./caesar.py -V -t "Joky oyz jgy Yiezgrk-Zuur but IxevzZuury!"`**
```
Most frequent character: y
Testing 'z' (ROT-1)        
Sorry. None of decrypted results seems to be written in language en_US...
```

Then, providing the correct language:

**`./caesar.py -V -t "Joky oyz jgy Yiezgrk-Zuur but IxevzZuury!" --lang "de_DE"`**
```
Most frequent character: y
Testing 's' (ROT-20)       SUCCESS
Decrypted with ROT-20. Original encryption key: 6
Dies ist das Scytale-Tool von CryptTools!
```

You can check all available codes with `./caesar.py --help`. You can even install more languages, for that take a look [here](http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/tutorial.html#adding-language-dictionaries).

If original text _**language is unknown**_ you still can generate all possible transformations, then you will need to check them manually in order to know which is the correct:

**`./caesar.py -V -A -t "Joky oyz jgy Yiezgrk-Zuur but IxevzZuury!"`**
```
Most frequent character: y
Testing 'e' (ROT-6)       Testing decrypted text:
"Puqe uef pme Eokfmxq-Faax haz OdkbfFaaxe!"
Testing 't' (ROT-21)       Testing decrypted text:
"Ejft jtu ebt Tdzubmf-Uppm wpo DszquUppmt!"
...
Testing 's' (ROT-20)       Testing decrypted text:
"Dies ist das Scytale-Tool von CryptTools!"
Testing 'h' (ROT-9)       Testing decrypted text:
"Sxth xhi sph Hrnipat-Idda kdc RgneiIddah!"
...
Testing 'q' (ROT-18)       Testing decrypted text:
"Bgcq gqr byq Qawryjc-Rmmj tml ApwnrRmmjq!"
Testing 'z' (ROT-1)       Testing decrypted text:
"Kplz pza khz Zjfahsl-Avvs cvu JyfwaAvvsz!"

Sorry. None of decrypted results seems to be written in language en_US...
```

Testing order is frequency order (most common letter is tested first).

In addition, with the extra option `-D` you can check the language validation process:

**`./caesar.py -VAD < test`**
```
Most frequent character: y
Testing 'e' (ROT-6)       Testing decrypted text:
"Estd td esp Nlpdlc ezzw qczx NcjaeEzzwd!"

estd: False              |  Progress 0%     | Max 88%
td: False                |  Progress 0%     | Max 75%
esp: True                |  Progress 12%    | Max 75%
nlpdlc: False            |  Progress 12%    | Max 62%
ezzw: False              |  Progress 12%    | Max 50%
qczx: False              |  Progress 12%    | Max 38%

Testing 't' (ROT-21)       Testing decrypted text:
"This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!"

this: True               |  Progress 12%    | Max 100%
is: True                 |  Progress 25%    | Max 100%
the: True                |  Progress 38%    | Max 100%
caesar: False            |  Progress 38%    | Max 88%
tool: True               |  Progress 50%    | SUCCESS

Decrypted with ROT-21. Original encryption key: 5
This is the Caesar tool from CryptTools!
```

`-A` and `-D` options may be too verbose, avoid using them for long texts.

You can also set the permissiveness of the language validation process with the `--threshold -T` option. By default it is set to 50 (half of the text words must be written in the specified language in order to accept it as the original text). Values must be between 1 and 100. Values below 20% are not recommended (an encrypted text may be accepted as decrypted). Higher values indicate toughness, but 100% it is neither recommended (in the text may be non-english nouns and other original but non-english words).

#### NOTE

As you can see, it is too easy to crack this classical cryptographic system so it is not recommended to use it in production software.

### Scytale

[--> What is a Scytale? <--](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale)

#### Usage

`./scytale.py --help`

```
usage: scytale.py [-h] [-t TEXT] [-k KEY] [-l LANG] [-V] [-A] [-D]
                  [-T THRESHOLD] [--beep]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEXT, --text TEXT  text to read from. If not specified the program will
                        read from standard input
  -k KEY, --key KEY     key used to encrypt. If no key is provided the program
                        will try to crack and decrypt using the specified
                        language
  -l LANG, --lang LANG  available languages: ['de_DE', 'en_AU', 'en_GB',
                        'en_US', 'fr_FR'] (default: en_US). Only useful if no
                        key is provided
  -V, --verbose         show extra information
  -A, --all             show decrypted text for each tested key
  -D, --debug           show information about text validation
  -T THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        valid word count percentage to mark the whole text as
                        valid language (default: 50)
  --beep                plays a beep sound when program finishes. May require
                        SOX to be installed
```

##### Examples

###### Encrypt a text and save to a file

**`./scytale.py -t "This is the Scytale tool from CryptTools!" -k 5 > test`**
```
Theoohe moi t lsSoCs cor!iyly st p  aft tlrT
```

`-t` argument is not mandatory, so if you need to encrypt a long text you can skip it, execute `./scytale.py -k 5 > test` and then paste your text. When completed press `Return` and then finish the input with `Ctrl+D` so the program will read it.

###### Encrypt with extra information

**`./scytale.py -t "This is the Scytale tool from CryptTools!" -k 5 -VA`**
```
Testing matrix: 5x9
Text to cipher: "This is the Scytale tool from CryptTools!" (41)
[['T' 'h' 'i' 's' ' ' 'i' 's' ' ' 't']
 ['h' 'e' ' ' 'S' 'c' 'y' 't' 'a' 'l']
 ['e' ' ' 't' 'o' 'o' 'l' ' ' 'f' 'r']
 ['o' 'm' ' ' 'C' 'r' 'y' 'p' 't' 'T']
 ['o' 'o' 'l' 's' '!' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ']]
Result size: 44
Theoohe moi t lsSoCs cor!iyly st p  aft tlrT
```

That matrix represents the Scytale. To encrypt the text it is written by rows (5) and read by columns (9).

###### Decrypt with a known key

To decrypt you will need to know the columns of the underlying matrix. In the example above they are 9.
If you only have the key 5 (rows) then you can calculate the columns with the text size:
`Columns = Size/Rows`. For example, the encrypted text above has size 44, so 44/5 = 8.8, rounding we have that columns are 9.

**`./scytale.py -k 9 < test`**
```
This is the Scytale tool from CryptTools!
```

###### Decrypt without knowing the key

This method cracks the message with bruteforce and then checks every result validating the language to guess which result is the original text. By default language is English, for other languages read below.

**`./scytale.py < test`**
```
This is the Scytale tool from CryptTools!
```

###### Advanced features

Read from a file and print cracked keys:

**`./scytale.py -V < test`**

##### Examples

###### Encrypt a text and save to a file

**`./vigenere.py -t "This is the Vigenere tool from CryptTools!" -k "CRYPT" > test`**
```
Vygh bu kft Okxccxtv rdhn wpdf EiwemVfmal!
```

`-t` argument is not mandatory, so if you need to encrypt a long text you can skip it, execute `./vigenere.py "CRYPT" > test` and then paste your text. When completed press `Return` and then finish the input with `Ctrl+D` so the program will read it.

###### Encrypt with extra information

**`./vigenere.py -t "This is the Vigenere tool from CryptTools!" -k "CRYPT" -V`**
```
Key "CRYPT" shifts: [2, 17, 24, 15, 19]
Vygh bu kft Okxccxtv rdhn wpdf EiwemVfmal!
```

###### Decrypt with a known key

To decrypt you will need to know the encryption key. In the example above it is _CRYPT_.
You need to provide the argument `--decrypt` to use the key to decrypt.

**`./vigenere.py -k "CRYPT" --decrypt < test`**
```
This is the Vigenere tool from CryptTools!
```

###### Decrypt without knowing the key

This method cracks the message testing with statistical methods and bruteforce and then checks every result validating the language to guess which result is the original text. In comparison to previous methods this will only work if the original text language is **English** because of the statistics methods it is using. In addition, in relation to this it is worth noting that long keys may contain some wrong letters. Given this limitation the maximum key length allowed by default is 100. Nevertheless you can force the program to test all possible key lengths using the argument `--exhaustive`. Also take in account that for small texts this program may fail, as we can see in the example below.

**`./vigenere.py < test`**
```
Sorry. None of decrypted results seems to be written in language en_US...
If you want to try more keys execute this program again with the option --exhaustive. However, it is worth noting that the longer the key is the more errors can have the cracked key. In addition, this program may have difficulties to crack keys on smaller texts in comparison with the key length.

Providing longer texts may be more successful:

Key: CRYPT
This method cracks the message testing with statistical methods and bruteforce and then checks every result validating the language to guess which result is the original text. In comparison to previous methods this will only work if the original text language is English because of the statistics methods it is using. In addition, in relation to this it is worth noting that long keys may contain some wrong letters. Given this limitation the maximum key length allowed by default is 100. Nevertheless you can force the program to test all possible key lengths using the argument --exhaustive. Also take in account that for small texts this program may fail, as we can see in the example below.
```

In addition, with the extra option `-D` you can check the language validation process in the same way that with previous cryptographic systems.

`-A` and `-D` options may be too verbose, avoid using them for long texts.

You can also set the permissiveness of the language validation process with the `--threshold -T` option. By default it is set to 50 (half of the text words must be written in the specified language in order to accept it as the original text). Values must be between 1 and 100. Values below 20% are not recommended (an encrypted text may be accepted as decrypted). Higher values indicate toughness, but 100% it is neither recommended (in the text may be non-english nouns and other original but non-english words).

#### NOTE

As you can see the choice of the key is important. In order to have a secure encryption you will need to provide a key of at least the length of the text and it needs to be unique for that text. However, nowadays there are many others cryptographic systems more advanced and useful.

### AES

[--> What is the AES Cipher? <--](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

#### Usage

`./aes.py --help`
```
usage: aes.py [-h] [-t TEXT] [-in INFILE] [-out OUTFILE] [-k KEY]
              [-kf KEYFILE] [-m MODE] [--decrypt]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEXT, --text TEXT  text to read from (by default: standard input bytes).
                        If text contains non-printable characters (special
                        bytes) then you will need to use --infile and
                        --outfile in order to do the conversion.
  -in INFILE, --infile INFILE
                        file to read from
  -out OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        file to write the result
  -k KEY, --key KEY     AES key used to encrypt or decrypt
  -kf KEYFILE, --keyfile KEYFILE
                        file containing the AES key used to encrypt or decrypt
  -m MODE, --mode MODE  operation mode, by default CBC. Supported: ECB, CBC,
                        CFB, OFB, OPENPGP
  --decrypt             use the key to decrypt the text
```

##### Examples

_This examples uses 128-bit key, but you can also use keys with 192 and 256 bits._

###### Encrypt and save to a file

_For text:_

**`./aes.py -t "This is the AES tool from CryptTools!" -k "Sixteen byte key" -out test.enc`**

Bytes:
```
b'\x8f\x88NP\x8e^5&\x95\x92<\x9c\x93s\xa1D;LP\x01\x17\x83@\xeb\x8d\x7fM\xbeZ\xc4\x10\x15\xd8K\xe2\x03O\xa5\x98\xcf\xef\xc0\x1c\x8dg>\xa62,Gx\xb9E\xa7\xe7&r\xedb"\xf7\x05+\x05'
```

**test.enc**:
```
Ê¤Ú@UXK*3pIR„$bÄÕó>Žx ·Ïô5S ªm¹ÿ’z>3Xe¿þAÙíê€–ÀR{å!vÕ
```

`-t` argument is not mandatory, so if you need to encrypt a long text you can skip it and paste your text in standard input. When completed press `Return` and then finish the input with `Ctrl+D` so the program will read it.

_For any file format:_
In order to encrypt images, binaries and other files you must provide input and output files with `-in` and `-out` parameters.

**`./aes.py -k "Sixteen byte key" -in test -out test.enc`**

###### Decrypt with a known key

Use the `--decrypt` parameter.

**`./aes.py -k "Sixteen byte key" --decrypt -in test.enc -out test`**

**test**:
```
This is the AES tool from CryptTools!
```

###### Advanced features

You can specify a key of 128, 192 or 256 bits which is inside a file:

**`./aes.py --keyfile test.key --decrypt -in test.enc -out test`**

**test.key**:
```
Sixteen byte key
```

You can specify the operation mode used for cipher multiple blocks.

**`./aes.py --keyfile test.key --decrypt -in test.enc -out test -m "ECB"`**

Defaults to **CBC**.
